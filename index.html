    <img src="Lo Mein.jpg">
    <p>First on the list we have Lo Mein, a simple yet <b>delicious</b> meal. What I love about this meal is how versataile and easy it is to cook, it takes about 15 minutes!</p>
    <p>Let alone how filling it is you can really add anything from tofu, beef, and veggies into this meal, and have an amazing filling meal in again, 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>Here we have another beautiful dish, which is the pork belly. The thing I love most about the pork belly if done right, it is a super juicy savory meal.</p>
    <p>Easily add <b>lo mein</b> or rice, even crab ragoons to finish the entire meal, and have an absolute delicious filling meal!</p>
    <p>If you are a savory pork lover this dish is just for you, with a crispy outer layer and juicy tender inner, you just cant go wrong.</p>

    <ol><h2>3 Fire Cracker Chicken</h2></ol>
    <img src="firecracker-chicken-.jpg">
    <p>At the finale choice of the best asian food I would consider firecracker-chicken taking the third spot.</p>
    <p>This crispy, sweet, yet spicy dish brings perfection to a different level, not fried but browned until crispy, it gives crispy a new defenition.</p>
    <p><b>packed</b> with a load of flavor and a spicy punch. Personally I enjoy this dish because I dont have the highest tolerance for spicy food.</p>
    <p>However, wth the mixes of sweet and spicy, this becomes a really tasty dish, serve it with rice, Lo Mein, or even steamed vegetables, or just by itself.</p>
